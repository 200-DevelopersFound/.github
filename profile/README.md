### 🦹‍♂️ A short introduction - <br>
We are all about creating cool projects and stuff which can help us to solve a day today problem. We started as a project to store all the wonderfull flutter things we could find on the internet and use it in our new project. While doing this, we suddenly got an amazing idea to create something together which can solve a problem and we ended up creating this organization. After creating this, we needed a project where we could actually solve a problem and hence came HAVO-an interesting project ... please do have a look and contribute.
